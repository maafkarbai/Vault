- **X and Y And Z can be 0 or 1**

# Why we don't need OR?
- **Everything in BOOLEN can be done** with **AND and NOT**
- **(X OR Y)** can also be solved also as: **AND(NOT(y))**
## Proof
- **(X OR Y) = AND (NOT(Y))** 
- **NOTO) = (x NAND x)**
- **(x AND y) = NOT(x NAND y)**
# NAND
- **(x NAND y) = NOT(x AND y)**

# What is Gate Diagram?
- It's the **logic of the gate like shown below using multiple gates (And NOT)**
- **Example:** Gate diagram of **FROM Gate**

- **Red lines are connections** to other gates **they must be named**
