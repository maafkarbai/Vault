# AX Register
- General Purpose Register 
- 8 bits

# What is nibble?
- group of **4 bits**
- from `0000` to `1111` (`0` to `15`)
- Byte = 2 nibbles

# `add` instruction
- Add the values of registers
- e.g. 
	 `add ax, bx`  
	 Add the values of ax and bx
	 then Put the value in ax register
# How to Compile ASM code in DOSBOX?
- we use nasm
- `nasm program-name.asm -o theoutputfile.com` 
	This takes the file and outputs/compiles to theoutputfile

# How to use an interrupt? `int`
- int interrupts the program
- use:
	`int memory-location(e.g. 0x21)`
	e.g.
		int 0x21 for executing 0x21 which terminates the program

# What is OP code? 
```timestamp-url 
 https://youtu.be/_JsroQdxkkM
 ```

- Instruction translated to Binary
- e.g. for : mov it is B8 (`B8 corresponds to mov instruction`)
	  `mov ax, 5`
	  The op code is ==> `00000000     B80500` 
		The code `B80500 is called machine code`
		and `the 00000000 is called the base Address of the first instruction of the program in the ram (it is not the zero of physical ram but the starting point of the program where the program is running)`

- So counting goes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F, 10 (one), 11 (one one)
- This makes total of 18 bytes (18  2-bits) (counting starts from 0)

# What does `[org 0x0100]` means in the start of program?

- Your `program runs in random location on your ram` 
- Let the `random location of ram = 0x1000`
- `[org 0x100]` means `random physical location of ram + 0x100` 
- The `random physical location of ram + 100` is now the `starting point` of the program i.e `0 of the program`
- DOS will then execute it like this
 ![[Pasted image 20241225180801.png]]
- The program starts will **0x100 (which is 0x1100 in physical)**
- Dos writes **0x100 as 0100** 


# **Little-Endian vs. Big-Endian**
- In **which order computer store values**? we use endian system
## Definitions
- **Little-Endian**: The **smallest part (Least Significant Byte)** comes **first** in memory.
- **Big-Endian**: The **biggest part (Most Significant Byte)** comes **first** in memory.
## Example Using `0x12345678` (Hexadecimal)
This number is **4 bytes long**:
- **`12` (Most Significant Byte)**
- **`34`**
- **`56`**
- **`78` (Least Significant Byte)**
#### **Little-Endian**
The **smallest byte (`78`) comes first** in memory:
### Little-Endian
| Memory Address | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|----------------|----|----|----|----|
| Data           | 78 | 56 | 34 | 12 |

### Big-Endian
The **biggest byte (`12`) comes first** in memory:

| Memory Address | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data           | 12  | 34  | 56  | 78  |


# What are Labels?
- Giving Address a name
- Used to give a **name to an address in ram** 
- Code is written on an address s
- We give that **address a name** 
![[Pasted image 20241230162147.png]]

## Working:
- **Label the location** where the code `int 0x21 code` is stored **as firstline**  
## Explanation
A label is a **named address for a specific memory location**. 
## Defining a Label
## Example:
### `numbertocall: dw 5`
- **numbertocall** is the **label**.
- **dw (Define Word) reserves a 2-byte memory space** and initializes it with the **value 5**.
- **label numbertocall points to the memory location where the value 5 is stored / opcode value because dw is an operation**.

## Accessing the Label's Value
When you write:
### `mov ax, [numbertocall]`
The instruction means: Move the value stored at the memory address labeled numbertocall into the AX register.

### Here's what happens step by step:
- The assembler **replaces numbertocall with the memory address** it represents.
- The **mov instruction looks at the value stored in the memory at that address**.
- It **copies the value (5, in this case) into the AX register**.

# What is DW?
![[Pasted image 20241230162422.png]]
## Working:
- **Allocate a word (16 bits) in ram** and **put value 5 (0005)** in it
- You can give this code line a label as well:

# Accessing Values from memory addresses Example (How to access values from memory address)
- **Store `0x00100` in `rbx`:**
## `mov rbx, 0x00100 

- `mov rbx, 0x00100`: Stores the **address** `0x00100` in `rbx`.
- `mov rax, [rbx]`: Retrieves the **value** stored at the memory location pointed to by `rbx`.


# Accessing Values in ARMV7
```

.global _start

_start:
    mov r1, #0x00B      // Load the memory address 0x00B into register r1
    ldr r2, [r1]        // Load the value at the memory address in r1 into r2

    // Add more operations or terminate the program properly
    mov r7, #1          // System call number for exit
    mov r0, #0          // Exit code 0
    svc 0               // Trigger the syscall

```
#### Key Changes

1. **Replaced `mov r2, [r1]` with `ldr r2, [r1]`**:
    
    - The `ldr` instruction is used for loading values from memory.
2. **Added an exit syscall for proper termination**:
    
    - Without proper termination, the program may behave unpredictably.
