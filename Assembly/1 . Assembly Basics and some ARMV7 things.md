# Word

- Depends on the processor architecture (32-bit or 64-bit):
  - **64-bit word** = 64 bits.
  - **32-bit word** = 32 bits.

# Half-Word

- Half the size of a word:
  - **64-bit half-word** = 32 bits.
  - **32-bit half-word** = 16 bits.

# Registers

- Memory locations close to the CPU.
- Limited storage capacity.
- Represented in hexadecimal.
- Can store 32 or 64 bits in a single register.
- **General-purpose registers**: `r0` to `r6`.

## r0 to r6 Registers

- General-purpose registers.
- Can store any type of data.

## r7 Register

- Stores info for ``system calls (interacting with the operating system)``.
- Example: Requesting a resource or terminating a program.
- **Perform system calls by storing a value in `r7`.**
- The value in `r7` maps to a system call table to determine the requested action.
- Uses 2 Methods for system calls:
	- System interrupts:
		- **System Interrupts** are mechanisms that allow external or internal events to signal the processor, temporarily stopping its current task to execute a higher-priority operation, typically managed through an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**
		- Goes to OS and says "Hey OS we need something done"  
	- System call numbers
		- Each system call has an assigned number. For example:
			- **0**: `read`
			- **1**: `write`
			- **2**: `open`
			- **3**: `close`


## sp Register (Stack Pointer)

- Points to the next memory location on the stack.
- The location is incremented by fixed steps:
  - +4 bytes for 32-bit systems.
  - +8 bytes for 64-bit systems.
- Example (32-bit): `0 → 4 → 8 → 12`.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Holds the address of the top of the stack.
  - Used for storing more complex data than registers.
  - Found in stack memory (inside RAM).

## Stack Behavior

#### Initial Value
- Set to a specific memory address during system initialization, typically at the end of RAM.

#### Automatic Updates
- The stack pointer moves up or down in fixed steps based on operations.

#### Stack Overflow
- Occurs when the stack pointer exceeds its allocated range (too many `PUSH` operations).

#### Stack Underflow
- Occurs when the stack is empty, and a `POP` operation is attempted.

## lr Register (Link Register)

- Stores the location of a function's return statement.

## pc Register (Program Counter)

- Points to the next instruction to be executed.

# CPSR (Current Program Status Register)

- A special-purpose register that holds the processor's current state.
- Similar to "if-statement" operations.
- Flags:
  - **N (Negative)**: Set to `1` if the result of an operation is negative.
  - **Z (Zero)**: Set to `1` if the result of an operation is zero.
  - **C (Carry)**: Set to `1` if an operation generates a carry (used in unsigned arithmetic).
  - **V (Overflow)**: Set to `1` if an operation causes overflow (used in signed arithmetic).

## Example: Addition Operation

Performing `5 + 3` and storing the result in a register.

### Step-by-Step

1. **Instruction 1**: Move `5` into Register `r0`.
   - The CPU takes the value `5` and places it in `r0`.
   - Result: `r0 = 5`.

2. **Instruction 2**: Move `3` into Register `r1`.
   - The CPU takes the value `3` and places it in `r1`.
   - Result: `r1 = 3`.

3. **Instruction 3**: Add the values in `r0` and `r1`, and store the result in `r2`.
   - The CPU performs the operation `5 + 3 = 8`.
   - Result: `r2 = 8`.

# CPSR vs SPSR

| Feature      | CPSR                                  | SPSR                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Function** | Reflects current processor state.     | Stores CPSR state during exceptions.    |
| **Scope**    | Always active, one per processor.     | One per exception mode.                 |
| **Usage**    | Manages processor state and controls. | Restores CPSR after exception handling. |

# Labels

## `start`

- Code is written after this label.

## `Global Label`

- Ensures that the program knows where the `start` label is located.

# Interrupt:
- An interrupt is a signal sent to the CPU that temporarily halts the current execution of a program to handle an event that requires immediate attention. After addressing the event, the CPU resumes its previous task.
##  Hardware Interrupt  
- A hardware interrupt is generated by an external device (e.g., keyboard, mouse, or timer) to notify the CPU of an event, such as a key press or incoming data. The CPU stops its current task, services the device, and then continues.
- **Example:** When you press a key, the keyboard sends an interrupt to let the CPU know a key has been pressed.

## Software Interrupt:
- A software interrupt is triggered intentionally by a program to request services from the operating system or perform specific tasks. It is invoked using an instruction like `INT` in assembly language.
- **Example:** A program calling `INT 0x21` in DOS to display a string on the screen.
- the 0x21 means the **value which corresponds to a specific task** like **0x21 corresponds to displaying a  string** 
# OP Code
- `MOV` Moves Data 
- Needs Source And Destination
- Destination comes first and then Source
- **Syntax**
		MOV Destination, Source
			e.g. `MOVE R0,#30` takes value 30 and puts in R0
			e.g.2. `MOVE R0,#0x0A` moves value `#0x0A` to `R0`
			`#` used to say that literal value is used not location or something

# Exiting Program
- MOV R7,#1 exits program
- Value of 1 corresponds to exit when executed in R7 

# Software Interrupt
- SWI  is used allow user-mode applications (software run on OS not on a kernel level) to access system resources or services provided by the operating system (e.g., file handling, memory allocation).
- SWI stands for **Software Interrupt**. It’s like a special way for normal applications (the programs you use every day) to ask the operating system for help when they need to do something they are not allowed to do directly.
- User Mode (Program)  
    |  
    | <-- SWI (request for system resources) -->  
    |  
Kernel Mode (Operating System)  
    |  
    | <-- Kernel executes the system call (I/O, computation, resource management) -->  
    |  
User Mode (Program)  
    |  
    | <-- Program resumes execution with the result (or error) from the kernel -->
    `

- To transfer control to a privileged mode (Administrator mode / supervisor) for executing critical operations.
###  **Examples**:
- **Saving a File**: A text editor uses SWI to tell the operating system to save your document on the hard drive.
- **Using Memory**: A game uses SWI to ask the operating system for memory space to load new levels.
- **Printing**: A photo editor uses SWI to ask the operating system to send your picture to the printer.

# Let OS take over after program execution
- `SWI 0`  This means let operating system back in control and pauses the program
- `SWI <immediate_value>` 

# Putting Hex values in MOV
- Use `#0xVALUE_OF_HEX`  
## **`SWI 0`** and **`SVC #0`
- They trigger software interrupt
- User mode to Kernel mode
- OS Handles operations then (I/O operations)

### **Types of System Calls**

1. **Process Control**
    
    - **`fork()`**: Creates a new process.
    - **`exec()`**: Replaces the current process with a new one.
    - **`exit()`**: Terminates the current process.
    - **`wait()`**: Waits for a child process to finish.
    - **`getpid()`**: Retrieves the process ID.
    - **`kill()`**: Sends a signal to a process.
2. **File Management**
    
    - **`open()`**: Opens a file.
    - **`read()`**: Reads data from a file.
    - **`write()`**: Writes data to a file.

    - **`errno()`**: Returns the last error code.
    - **`perror()`**: Prints error messages.

### `SWI 0` in ARMv7

1. A user program executes `MOV R0, #0` (preparing a parameter, e.g., 0 for exit).
2. The program then executes `SWI 0`, which triggers a **software interrupt**.
3. The CPU:
    - Saves the current context of the user program.
    - Switches to **kernel mode**.
    - Executes the kernel-level system call handler for **system call 0**, which might be an **exit** function.
4. The kernel process completes, and the CPU:
    - Restores the user program’s state.
    - Returns control to the program in **user mode**, resuming normal execution (or terminating the program if it was an exit).

## Everyday Analogy for SWI	
Imagine you're in a library:		
		1. **Raise your hand** = `swi` instruction.
		2. **Show a number** = The value you pass (e.g., `#1` or `#2`).
		3. **Librarian checks the number** = The system checks what you need.
		4. **Librarian does the task** = The system performs the requested task.
		5. **You continue studying** = The program resumes.

# FETCH,DECODE, EXECUTE, STORE cycle ([[How CPU Works]]) 
The cycle involves four key stages:
1. **Fetch**: The CPU gets (fetches) the next instruction from memory().
2. **Decode**: The CPU interprets (decodes) what the instruction means.
3. **Execute**: The CPU performs the operation specified by the instruction.
4. **Store**: The result of the execution is stored back in memory or a register.
This cycle repeats endlessly while the computer is running.
# What does 32 bit, 64 Bit Processor mean?
- That means that GP (General Purpose Registers) are 32 or 64 bits

# what is section `.bss`
- This contains variables that might change

# what is section `.data`
- This contains **constants (not changing data)**

### Declaring constants example

```
section .data
	hello: db "Hello", 10 

```
- `hello` is a **label**, like a name or identifier for the data.
- `db` means **Define Byte**. It tells the assembler to store the following bytes in memory.
- `"Hello"` is the actual data being stored, which is a string of characters.
- `10` is an extra byte added at the end. In this case, it represents a **newline character** (ASCII value for a line break).
